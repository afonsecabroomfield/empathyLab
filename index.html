            <h2>Introduction to Web Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
              When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded,
              people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many
              sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that
              make them difficult or impossible for some people to use. Making
              the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society.
              International web standards define what is needed for
              accessibility.

            <h2>What is Web Accessibility?</h2>
            <p>
              Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are
              designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use
              them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand,
              navigate, and interact with the Web contribute to the Web Web
              accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to
              the Web, including: auditory cognitive neurological physical

              Web accessibility is not a new concept, but it is now more
              relevant than ever, with almost 2 billion people living with
              disabilities worldwide and relying on the web for information,
              education, and more.

                Imagine a table on a webpage as a neatly organized grid of
                information, like rows and columns in a spreadsheet. For someone
                relying on a screen reader due to visual impairment, this tool
                reads out the content, describing headers at the top that act
                like titles for each column. It enables easy navigation,
                allowing users to move through the table's cells and explore the
                information. Just as buildings have ramps for accessibility, web
                developers ensure tables are accessible to all by using features
                that work with screen readers, creating a welcoming online
                experience where everyone, regardless of abilities, can
                understand and engage with the content effortlessly.

              Assistive technology refers to devices, tools, software, or
              equipment designed to help people with disabilities perform tasks
              that might be challenging or impossible for them otherwise. These
              technologies aim to enhance the independence, quality of life, and
              accessibility of individuals with disabilities. Assistive
              technology can cover a wide range of areas, including mobility,
              communication, hearing, vision, and cognitive abilities. Examples
              of assistive technology include screen readers for the visually
              impaired, hearing aids for those with hearing loss, communication
              devices for individuals with speech impairments, adaptive
              keyboards for those with motor challenges, and many other
              specialized tools tailored to meet specific needs. The goal of
              assistive technology is to bridge the gap between people with
              disabilities and the opportunities provided by technology,
              education, employment, and daily life.

  <li><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> All Employees should foster awareness and understanding of accessibility principles. Provide training sessions or resources on creating inclusive content, designing accessible interfaces, and considering diverse user needs.</li>

  <li><strong>Inclusive Communication:</strong> All Employees should use clear and concise language in written and verbal communication. Provide alternative formats for important information, such as meeting agendas, to accommodate diverse needs.</li>

  <li><strong>Document Accessibility:</strong> Content Creators should ensure that documents, presentations, and other content are created with accessibility in mind. This includes using proper heading structures, alternative text for images, and accessible document formats.</li>

  <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Leadership and Management should foster a culture of continuous improvement by regularly assessing and enhancing accessibility policies, practices, and technologies within the organization.</li>

  <li><strong>Advocacy and Support:</strong> Managers and Colleagues should advocate for accessibility initiatives and support colleagues who may require accommodations. Foster an inclusive work environment where diversity and accessibility are valued.</li>
